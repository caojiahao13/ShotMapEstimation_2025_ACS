# Supplementary Materials for "What Influences the Field Goal Attempts of Professional Players? Analysis of Basketball Shot Charts via Log Gaussian Cox Processes with Spatially Varying Coefficient"

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the paper titled "What Influences the Field Goal Attempts of Professional Players? Analysis of Basketball Shot Charts via Log Gaussian Cox Processes with Spatially Varying Coefficient."

We provide three Jupyter notebooks with R code and instructions to reproduce all the reported results in the manuscript:

* `Simulation/simulation.ipynb`: Conducts the simulation study in Section 4 and generates the corresponding figures.
* `RealDataAnalysis/GenerateFigures.ipynb`: Generates the main figures for the real dataset and the resulting fitting results.
* `RealDataAnalysis/ModelComparison.ipynb`: Conducts a model comparison on the real dataset between the proposed method and several competitive models.
